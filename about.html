		<p>I am a computer science student at Mountain Vista High School. My main goal with this game was to make something that was challenging, yet everyone could play. I, myself, am very bad a gaming but I found this game perfect for my skill level but still held a challenge! Welcome to Planet Atlas! //MY IDOL IS DOWN BELOW//</p>

		<p>I attend Mountain Vista High School as a sophomore. While I am very good at playing video games I still found Planet Atlas quite challenging. This was very fun to work on and I hope you enjoy this game! //MY IDOL IS DOWN BELOW//</p>
